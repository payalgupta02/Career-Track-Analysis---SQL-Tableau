Using **SQL** for data preparation and **Tableau** for visualization, the project uncovers:  
- Track popularity & learner preferences  
- Single vs multiple registrations  
- Seasonal enrollment trends  
- Completion duration & patterns  
---

### Key Findings 
- **Data Analyst track dominates enrollments** compared to BA and DS.  
- **~80% learners register for only one track**, showing sequential learning preference.  
- **Seasonal peaks** in enrollments during August and winter breaks.  
- **Completion timelines vary**: most finish within 60 days, but some extend beyond a year.  
---

### Recommendations  
- Promote bundled pathways (e.g., DA + BA) with discounts.  
- Launch seasonal campaigns (August & December).  
- Use nudges (emails, badges) to reduce long completion delays.  
- Highlight Data Analyst track as the **gateway to advanced learning**.
